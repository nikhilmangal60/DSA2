Recursion Approach- 3 Type(work with all subsequence type of question like max subsequence sum/ min subsequence sum)
  1. Take and not take- index+1 for both(eg - take number unique number of times for subsequence type of questions)
  2. Take and not take- index+1 for not take and index for take(eg- take number any number of times)
  3. Recursion with for loop(eg-if the input contains duplicate numbers and you need to find all subset with non duplicate subset/ take number unique number of times)----- optimised approach

i) Grid Pattern- 
If start point is fixed and end is variable in grid(for ex- Traingle)
If start point is variable and end is fixed in grid(for ex- Ninja Training)
If start point is variable and end is variable in grid(for ex- Min falling path sum)
