Recursion Approach- 3 Type
  1. Take and not take- index+1 for both(eg - take number unique number of times for subsequence type of questions)
  2. Take and not take- index+1 for not take and index for take(eg- take number any number of times)
  3. Recursion with for loop(eg- take number unique number of times)----- optimised approach
